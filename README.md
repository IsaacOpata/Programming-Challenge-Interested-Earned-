# Programming-Challenge-Interested-Earned-
Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in saving account after on year may be calculated as

Amount = Principal * (1+(Rate/T))^T

Princiapl is the balance in the saving account, Rate is the interest rate, and T is the number of times the interest is compunded during a year (T is 4 the ineterest is compounded quarterly).
Write a program that asks for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times the interest is compounded. It should display a report similar to:

Interest Rate:             2.25
Times Compounded:            12
Principal:          $   1000.00
Imterest:           $     43.34
Amount in Savings:  $   1043.34
